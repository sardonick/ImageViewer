# ImageViewer
A program for exploring JPEG quantization tables

This was a project done for a multimedia course. It loads a bmp file, converts it to JPEG and allows you to play around with the quantization tables and see the effects. It depends on the Java Advanced Imaging library which unfortunately is quite old and requires the use of Java version 1.8. Installation instructions can be found in setup-guide.txt.
